# ðŸŒ€ Agentic Architectural Patterns

## The "Twin" Pattern
- From IoT: each resource has a digital twin  
- In Kubernetes: controllers already play this role  
- With agents:  
  - Smarter, self-describing twins  
  - Participate in conversations & planning  
  - Can manage health, debug, and coordinate actions
